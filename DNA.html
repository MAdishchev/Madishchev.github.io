        <h1>DNA</h1>
            <h2>
                DNA, the carrier of genetic information in living things, has been used in criminal justice for decades.
                But how, exactly, does DNA profiling work? Given a sequence of DNA, how can forensic investigators identify
                to whom it belongs?
            </h2>
            <h2>

                Well, DNA is really just a sequence of molecules called nucleotides,
                arranged into a particular shape(a double helix).
                Every human cell has billions of nucleotides arranged in sequence.
                Each nucleotide of DNA contains one of four different bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G),
                or thymine(T). Some portions of this sequence (i.e., genome) are the same, or at least very similar,
                across almost all humans,but other portions of the sequence have a higher genetic diversity and thus
                vary more across the population.
